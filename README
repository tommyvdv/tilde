Tilde
=====

Collection of config-, script-, dotfiles, etc... one is likely to find in a
regular *NIX like home directory.

The name is taken from https://github.com/janmoesen/tilde
I always thought it was better naming than `etc` or `dotfiles`.

Instead of symlinking all the stuff, I took the approach of hardcore pulling
into the home directory, cf. https://github.com/garybernhardt/dotfiles/

My vim config is still a separate repo, I'm undecided on whether or not to merge
it with tilde, or make it a submodule, or...


Install
-------

	$ cd
	$ git init
	$ git remote add origin <gitrepo>

Resolve shit if necessary
